Task 1

What should be done
# Spring Auto Configuration

Create Basic Spring application which will have Data Source Configuration provided by spring Auto-Configuration:

- Introduce a configuration(using @Configuration) which should have a method annotated with @Bean which returns a configured data source instance.
- Use https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2 as a Data Source.
- Add test which tests your application by saving an entity to the data source.

# Custom Configuration

Create Custom configuration for data source based on conditional properties:

- Introduce a configuration(using @Configuration) which should return a data source if an instance of provided interface doesn't exist(@ConditionalOnMissingBean).
- Add test which tests your application by saving an entity to the data source.

# Spring Actuator

- Enable actuator by adding https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency.
- Expose Default Spring Actuator by configuring SecurityWebFilterChain bean.
- Add a new custom actuator endpoint(using @Component and @Endpoint(id = ...)) and return a custom response.
- Spring Profiles (optional, should be done when previous items are complete)

# Separate Data Source Configurations Using Profiles:

- There should be 2 different Data Sources - one for QA and one for DEV.
- Introduce 2 data sources(using @Component and @Profile("QA")/ @Component and @Profile("DEV"))
- Implement test(using @ActiveProfile("DEV")) which tests your application by requesting data from DEV Data Source.
